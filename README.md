# Let's build a website together!

I've had this idea for a while now where people can submit pieces of code that end up turning into an amazing website.

Here is the current design that the community has created https://briancodex.github.io/community-website/

## :white_check_mark: How to Contribute

Click on the Issues tab and you'll notice there will be specific issues that need to be created. Choose an issue that you'd like to work on and comment on the issue. It is very important that you comment on the issue because the first comment is the one who gets priority for creating that section.

If two people comment on the same issue, the first person who commented will get that section and the other person will have to choose a different section.

## :exclamation: Important

If the first person who commented does not push any code within a 24 hour period, someone else can take that section. There's a lot of people that want to contribute, so if you are taking too long to upload your section, I will have to push whoever ends up submitting their code first. 

I will try to reply to comments within a 12 hour period. You will have to wait until I reply and assign you to the issue. If you try to push code and you aren't the person assigned to the issue, I will not accept your request. 

Last thing, make sure you create a new branch when you commit. If you are not familiar with creating branches on github, be sure to watch some tutorials on it before commiting.


## :clipboard: Summary

The starter code consist of HTML, CSS and Javascript.

If you don't know how to submit a pull request, simply search it on Youtube and you'll find a lot of tutorials showing how to do it. Be sure to look at videos on how to work on Github issues.

Depending on how many people participate, I might feature this on my Youtube channel @Brian Design and everyone can check the repository and see who contributed to it.

## :bulb: Feedback
If you'd like to add any additional comments or feature request, just add a new issue or add a comment so I can take a look. Also, you can check out the project tab to see the progress of the website.

This is currently a Beta test, so I'm still trying to figure out the best way to collaboration without causing any issues. If you have any suggestions, reach out to me on any of my socials
